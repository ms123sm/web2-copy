# Create your models here.

#what is models?
# In Django, models are a fundamental part of the framework's ORM (Object-Relational Mapping) system. They represent the structure of your data and provide an abstraction layer that allows you to interact with your database using Python code rather than SQL queries. 

# for each player, this data should be saved:
# username
# nickname
# score
# image

# Do we need to learn SQL? NO
